prototyping with "hobbyist" robotics. 

## Posdoc at Lisbon University
Since beginning of 2019, I am on leave and I have been a postdoc researcher in Prof. Tiago Guerreiro research group at Lisbon University.

## Projects

In 2019 first semester, I had involved in a project to teach basics of programming to children with visual impairment using robotics and tangibles. This project was lead by Ana Pires, also a postdoc researcher, and by professors Tiago Guerreiro and Hugo Nicolau.
Now, after data analysis of focus groups with teachers of visual impaired children (TVIs), done as part o the project mentioned, I have been using the [WonderPy Python API](https://github.com/playi/WonderPy), the [reacTVIsion](http://reactivision.sourceforge.net) computer vision framework, and some electronics to track and control the Dash robot using tangibles with NFC tags. This [GitHub fork page](https://github.com/ajbn/WonderPyExamples), I have been working on, has more detalis.
